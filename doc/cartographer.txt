INTRODUCTION                                    *cartographer*

Does your vimrc and associated list of plugins keep growing and growing?
Recently stumbled across that neat plugin you installed years ago and have used
once? Or the one you wrote and never used?

Welcome to my world. Cartographer tracks commands and mappings these plugins
install and can tell you which are unused, along with any entire scripts that
are unused.

COMMANDS                                        *cartographer-commands*

                                                *:CartographerLog*
:CartographerLog[!]     Display a short summary of used scripts. Pass `!` to
                        view unused scripts.

HEALTH

Cartographer installs a |health| check to display details on used
commands and mappings (first and last use time, number of uses) and
scripts with unused commands, mappings or both (these are shown as
warnings).

STORAGE                                         *cartographer-storage*

Cartographer stores its statistics in `$XDG_STATE_HOME/cartographer.log`, and
will merge with any changes made to this by other instances of nvim.
